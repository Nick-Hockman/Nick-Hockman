  <h1>One with Our Mind</h1>
  <p>Medium: Animation Video</p>
		<p></p>
<p>8 seconds</p>

<p>This video can have many interpretations which is why I titled it so vague.  This video was originally how I felt during this whole pandemic.  Pretty much spent more screen time in these last three months then most of last year.  So I used After Effects to poetry this sort of feeling of one becoming one with the online world which functions very differently then the real world.  This can also have other interpretations like an addiction or a victim.
    One thing I wanted to include wassome erry music however I'm not sure how to download videos from youtube so I made it silent so it acted more like a gif.  I wanted to have an angel of the person from a close up perspective of the eye of the person in which its acting odd though this looks more horror.  The horror aspect of this sets a negative tone for this picture.
